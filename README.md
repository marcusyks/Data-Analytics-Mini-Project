# Data-Analytics-Mini-Project

This mini project is an embark on whether food can be categorised by its macronutrients. My teammates and I first sifted through the food.csv dataset and filtered the data. Afterwards, we did exploratory analysis on the data: finding macronutrients that were important and correlation between nutrients and food items.

For machine learning, we embarked on two clustering methods: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. However, we found hierarchical clustering to be ineffective and hence, we stuck on with K-Means Clustering. Using PCA to reduce dimensionality of the data, hopkins statistics to determine the clustering tendency and sihoulette analysis and elbow curve to determine the number of clusters, we classified our data into clusters.
